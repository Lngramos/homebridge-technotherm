# Homebridge Technotherm

A plugin for instrumenting Technotherm Eletrical Partial Thermal-Storage Heaters in Homebridge.

**Status:** Experimental ðŸ§ª

Potentially can be modified to support a variety of other radiators (e.g. Haverland) that use the same cloud service for configuration (api.helki.com).

## Audience: developers

Works for me, might work for you! You'll need to be comfortable digging into homebridge code if you want to tinker/add functionality or figure out why something doesn't work, but there's nothing esoteric in there, just wiring up APIs.

##Â Requirements

* **Username**: username registered with Lucht LHZ app
* **Password**: password registered with the Lucht LHZ app

## Credits

This would have been a lot more difficult without Graham Bennett's [smartbox](https://github.com/graham33/smartbox) project, and
the various contributors in the [Home Assistant forum discussion around it](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/haverland-radiators-smart-box-integration/133596). Thanks to everyone there!
